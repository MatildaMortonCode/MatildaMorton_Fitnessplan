It is useful to consider BMI alongside waist circumference, as waist measurement helps to assess risk by measuring the amount of fat carried around your middle.

BMI is a useful measurement for most people over 18 years old. But it is only an estimate and it doesnâ€™t take into account age, ethnicity, gender and body composition. Like we mentioned earlier, don't get too focused on BMI ro the scales when starting and take lots of before and afters, this just helps us to create a custom plan for you!
