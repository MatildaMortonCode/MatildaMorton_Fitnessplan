awesome


puts "Thanks for that! Now we are going to calculate your Body Mass Index, this is calculated off your height and weight

It is useful to consider BMI alongside waist circumference, as waist measurement helps to assess risk by measuring the amount of fat carried around your middle.

BMI is a useful measurement for most people over 18 years old. But it is only an estimate and it doesnâ€™t take into account age, ethnicity, gender and body composition. Like we mentioned earlier, don't get too focused on BMI ro the scales when starting and take lots of before and afters, this just helps us to create a custom plan for you! We will also take into consideration your current excercise levels."
